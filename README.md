## Soft Skills
  
They are the skills you need out of the technical area. They are essential as much as technical skills.
  
### Self Confidence
It is needed to show/promote yourself. You should balance it, not too much, not too less.  

There are some tricks to gain some self confidence,
- Put real, professional, friendly, cool profile pictures on social profiles such as Linkedin, Twitter, GitHub, Medium, etc.
- Make social profiles public
- Share your knowledge on social profiles
- Be aware of your skills
- Do not call yourself Junior everytime

### Email Usage
When you want to start a conversation that is essential/serious, email comes to help.

Here are some tips/information about how the email works,
- The receiver can see CC, not BCC
- Put your manager to CC in case the email contains essential information/decision
- Ask the recruiter to send you the job contract via email. It shows you are professional and you will get the offer in a serious way.
- Fill the email message like you write an essay
- Start the email with `Hello`, `Hi XXX`, end it with `Best Regards`, `Have a Good Day`
- Tell the situation as clear as you can
