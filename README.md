## Soft Skills
They are the skills you need out of the technical area. They are essential as much as technical skills.
  
### Self Confidence
It is needed to show/promote yourself. You should balance it, not too much, not too less.  

There are some tricks to gain some self confidence,
- Put real, professional, friendly, cool profile pictures on social profiles such as Linkedin, Twitter, GitHub, Medium, etc.
- Make social profiles public
- Share your knowledge on social profiles
- Be aware of your skills
- Do not call yourself Junior everytime

### Email Usage
When you want to start a conversation that is essential/serious, email comes to help.

Here are some tips/information about how the email works,
- The receiver can see CC, not BCC
- Put your manager to CC in case the email contains essential information/decision
- Ask the recruiter to send you the job contract via email. It shows you are professional and you will get the offer in a serious way.
- Fill the email message like you write an essay
- Start the email with `Hello`, `Hi XXX`, end it with `Best Regards`, `Have a Good Day`
- Tell the situation as clear as you can

### Resume
Your resume is your first impression that must be great to make the further steps easier for you.

There are some common thoughts most of the developers agree with,
- Find a cool template. It does not have to be colorful, just cool. Hire a designer to build one for you
- Make it consistent, font, colors, alignment
- It's highly recommended that it should not over a single page. No HR person is looking forward to reading your all resume carefully. Make their work easier
- Order sections by importance. Generally, the order from top to bottom is, personal information(e-mail, place), about(telling yourself), experience, projects, skills, certificates, education. Some of the sections might be more powerful than others, move them to upper
- No one needs your private personal information, such as long address, gsm, married or not. You don't have to put them in your resume
- Adapt your picture by the continent. The companies are in United States don't prefer pictures in your resume. They only care about your skills, not look. Other countries are not strict as in United States
- Put a picture that shows your professionality, sincerity. Don't be look like too formal or informal, just normal. Of course, smile :)
- Do not score your skills. It make looks you amateur. You might have limited knowledge in the area you score yourself. How can you score yourself then? Let others score you
- Use specific keywords are related to your technology domain. Use them in the projects, experience sections. HR looks for them
- Do not pass the about section without telling yourself in. HR is the first person he/she will have a look at your resume. You are supposed to impress him/her first. Tell your soft skills, hobbies in the about section.
- Write the resume in English
